###This file will walk you through the different steps and requirements of the analysis#
###You may also look at the different scripts to see more details.

###required directories
###
#You need a main directory were are your files are and analysis will be done (here this is /media/seb_1TB/transposon)
#In this directory you'll have different subdirectories
#data/ : contains the data as _1.fq/_2.fq files or sub directories which contain several fastq.gz (eg. : "Goblinvalley_AGTCAA_L006_R1_001.fastq.gz", where 001 indicates it is the first subfile, and R1 means it is pair 1 or 2.) files which need to be unzipped and concatenated.
#results/ : will contain the main result table
#alignments/: will contain the alignments generated by bwa.
#Rcode/ : contains the Rcode required for analysis 
#reference/ : contains the reference fasta file (here HA412_trinity_noAltSplice_400bpmin.fa) and a list of the .fq sequences ("hybrid_species") in the proper format ("path\to\sequence"	"species"	"ill"	"sanger").
#mpileup/ : will contain temporatory files generated by mpileup. 
#mpileup/cmd : will contain temporatory files generated by mpileup.

###
###required files & programs
###
#Unix based machine (Mac or Linux), >2-core machine.
#reference transcriptome (.fasta file and split file), sequence files (.fastq), list of 
#R (â‰¥ 2.15.0, http://www.r-project.org/)
#bwa (http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/)
#samtools (http://samtools.sourceforge.net/)
#working copy of java (http://www.java.com/en/download/index.jsp)
#trimmomatic (http://www.usadellab.org/cms/index.php?page=trimmomatic)
#vcfutils.pl (from samtools, but copy it to your Rcode directory)

###
### Running analysis
###
#analysis were all ran from the command line (although one could run them directly from the R console too)

$nohup ./Rcode/trimmomatic.R 1 18 >trim.log& #here numbers are for the files you want to process.
$nohup ./Rcode/alignments.R 1 18 >align.log&
$nohup ./Rcode/alignments_stats.R 1 18 >stats.log&
$nohup ./Rcode/snp.R deserticola 8 snp >snp_des.log& #here number is for CPUs
$nohup ./Rcode/snp.R anomalus 8 snp >snp_ano.log& 
$nohup ./Rcode/snp.R paradoxus 8 snp >snp_par.log& 
$nohup ./Rcode/snp.R deserticola 16 snp_stats >snp_stats.log&

###You are done! You may need to remove a few unwanted log files, unpaired trimmomatic files, .bam.bai files. Put everything together, submit your data, write a paper and voila!

###Any questions?
